# Web Development Project 5 - *Data Dashboard*

Submitted by: **David Bucio-Paz**

This web app: **This app will demonstrate recipes in a dashboard and display ten different recipes with three summary statistics of the food, ex. servings, cooking time, and preparation time. Users can search for a specific recipe and results show up as recipes with similar names pop up. The additional filter is a filter that shows up recipes that are gluten free or not and dashboard adjusts dynamically.  **

Time spent: **4** hours spent in total
